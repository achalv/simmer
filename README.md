# Simmer
Simmer is an HTML boilerplate. Geddit?! Boiler. Plate.

Starting a new project, but don't want to write all that boilerplate code? Think you missed something? I know that feeling.
Simmer is the boilerplate HTML code I use for new projects because I don't like writing the same thing over and over again. It has everything you need, and nothing you don't. 

I also added an annotated version of index.html so you know why I've added whatever I've added to Simmer.
Have fun!
